Prerequisite for running the code (Python):
Please create a virtualenv and install the libraries recorded in requirements.txt:

$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you can run the code as a binary or with python interpreter:
$ python problem_1.py 


(a)
The function "create_large_random_file()" is responsible for creating the large file 
of records in the desired format (gender, age, country) with random integers. We used 
the csv format and added a header to be reproducible.

(b)
The function "median_age" is the actual implementation of the algorithm and the 
"read_csv" generator is used to efficiently read the file into memory.

(c)
The scalability test is done in the main part of the script and a plotting is done 
to verify that the complexity of the algorithm is actualy linear. The picture is 
available by the name "problem_1(c).png"
